title: Research Scientist- Audio Deepfake Detection
use-site-title: true
---

<br> Joined Pindrop as a Research Scientist specializing in Computer Science. My role involves the development of a robust deepfake detection system, aimed at addressing real-world challenges. My research interests include Deepfake detection, Speaker recognition and Anti-spoofing.<br><br>

I graduated (Ph.D.) from Sorbonne University, France, worked in the Audio Security and Privacy group, supervised by Prof. Nicholas Evans.
I have interned in the Voice-ID group at Amazon, USA in 2022.

	<li><i>May 2025: Im thrilled to announce that we are organizing a special session on <b>Source Tracing for Audio Deepfake Detection</b> at Interspeech 2025 conference - marking the first time this important and emerging topic will be featured at the interspeech conference. This session has received 18 papers and 11 high quality papers were accepted. These contribution explore cutting-edge techniques and novel approaches to identifying the origin of deepfake audio and strengthening defenses against deepfake attacks. Join us as we take a significant step forward in advancing the field of trustworthy AI <a href="https://www.interspeech2025.org/special-sessions">. Find details here </a>.
