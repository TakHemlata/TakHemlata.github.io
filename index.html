title: Research Scientist- Audio Deepfake Detection
use-site-title: true
---

<br> Joined Pindrop as a Research Scientist specializing in Computer Science. My role involves the development of a robust deepfake detection system, aimed at addressing real-world challenges. My research interests include Deepfake detection, Speaker recognition and Anti-spoofing.<br><br>

I graduated (Ph.D.) from Sorbonne University, France, worked in the Audio Security and Privacy group, supervised by Prof. Nicholas Evans.
I have interned in the Voice-ID group at Amazon, USA in 2022.
